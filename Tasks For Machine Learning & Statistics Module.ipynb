    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We have been tasked with writing a  Python function that calculates the square root of 2 and prints it to the screen to 100 decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "The square root of a number is a specified quantity given when multiplied by itself. In mathematics it is generally represented  by the radical sign or radix √. It must be a positive number though in mathematics square roots of negative numbers are sometimes used and  are  known as imaginary numbers. The square root of 2 is known as an irrtaional number as it cannot be expressed as a fraction and has a never ending number of decimal numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "## History\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pythagorean philosophers had a great focus on numbers and geometry and and guarded it as secret knowledge believeing they wwere gaining insight into  the make up of the universe itself. They believed all numbers were rational and could be expressed as a ratio of integer values. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is believed  that their belief in this concept was so strong that when when Hippasus discovered irrational numbers he was thrown from a boat and left to drown though this  event is seen as more of a myth than concrete factual truth due to conflicting reports from Iamblichus.<sup>[1]</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has some built in limitations on how it runs its calculations. This is due to the fact that Python works on a base 2 system which cannot represent all decimal fractions exactly. This results in decimal floating-point numbers being approximated by the binary number stored. Floats are generally calculated using the first 53 bits beginning with the significant bit with a denominator as a power of 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not a unique feature of a binary system. All base systems have limitations on their accuracies. If we consider our well understood base 10 system the fraction 1/3 can never be brought to it's full decimal representation. It can be shown to be 0.3, 0.33,  0.333 etc. Each additionnal decimal point brings us closer to the true value but we never reach the final value.<sup>[2]</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Computational Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several computational methods of calcluting the squareroot of a number. We shall be delving into the below methods-\n",
    "* Babylonian Method\n",
    "* Bakhshali Method\n",
    "* Newton-Raphson Method\n",
    "\n",
    "## Babylonian Method\n",
    "\n",
    "This was one of thhe first known alogorithms or computing the square root of a number. It is believed to have been discovered in about 1,500BC by the babyloniansand is also known as the Heron's Method. It works by guessing an initial over estimate number x<sub>0</sub> to the square root of a non negative real number S then S/x<sub>0</sub> will be an under estimate providing a better approximation of the real value by an average of the 2 numbers using the below formula <sup>[3][4]</sup>\n",
