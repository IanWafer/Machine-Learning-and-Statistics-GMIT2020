Assignments
This is an assignment set out by Ian Mcloughin for the Machine Learning Module of the Data Analytics higher diploma by GMIT. The 4 assignments given where as follows- 
1. October 5th, 2020: Write a Python function called sqrt2 that calculates and prints to the screen the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places. Your code shoul not depend on any module from the standard library1 or otherwise. You should research the task first and include references and a description of your algorithm.

2. November 2nd, 2020: The Chi-squared test for independence is a statistical hypothesis test like a t-test. It is used to analyse whether two categorical variables are independent. The Wikipedia article gives the table below as an example , stating the Chi-squared value based on it is approximately 24.6. Use scipy.stats to verify this value and calculate the associated p value. You should include a short note with references justifying your analysis in a markdown cell.
|           | A   | B  | C   | D   | Total |
|-----------|-----|----|-----|-----|-------|
| White     | 90  | 60 | 104 | 95  | 349   |
| Blue      | 30  | 50 | 51  | 20  | 151   |
| No Collar | 30  | 40 | 45  | 35  | 150   |
| Total     | 150 | 15 | 200 | 150 | 650   |

3. November 16th, 2020: The standard deviation of an array of numbers x is calculated using numpy as np.sqrt(np.sum((x - np.mean(x))**2)/len(x)) . However, Microsoft Excel has two different versions of the standard deviation calculation, STDEV.P and STDEV.S . The STDEV.P function performs the above calculation but in the STDEV.S calculation the division is by len(x)-1 rather than len(x) . Research these Excel functions, writing a note in a Markdown cell about the difference between them. Then use numpy to perform a simulation demonstrating that the STDEV.S calculation is a better estimate for the standard deviation of a population when performed on a sample. Note that part of this task is to figure out the terminology in the previous sentence.

4. November 30th, 2020: Use scikit-learn to apply k-means clustering to Fisherâ€™s famous Iris data set. You will easily obtain a copy of the data set online. Explain in a Markdown cell how your code works and how accurate it might be, and then explain how your model could be used to make predictions of species of iris.
